    "It is worth mentioning here the different kinds of Bioactivities that an assay can report. Depending on what was relevant to the scientists involved in the study, various values can be used. Possibly most importantly for generating this dataset though is to not confuse the different kinds of activities. We will focus on IC50, which is the concentration of the compound at which 50% inhibition is observed. The value is normal reported as a \"Micromolar concentration\". The lower the value, the better the compound is at inhibiting the protein. It is important to not be tempted to use the \"Activity\" reported in some assays, which is normally a % and corresponds to how much that compound inhibits the protein at a given concentration. We're sticking with IC50 because this value is very information rich and actually many \"Activity\" experiments go into producing 1 IC50 value. Also they are more easily comparable, as we don't need to standardize concentration across the assays."
